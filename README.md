![alt text](images/smartphone_demo.gif)

## A web-app designed to aid self-diagnosis for individuals worried that something might be amiss. Still in the nascent stages of development.

### How to run?
- First run the server.py file in the server directory
- Then, find out the ```Ipv4``` address of the current wifi connection you are using from your laptop
- Preferably use a smartphone for this step. Go to Chrome and type in ```https://your-ip-address:9787``` (The port address is 9787)
- All set!
